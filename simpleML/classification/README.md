# simpleML - Classification
:soon:

Classification Module is a supervised machine learning module which is used for classifying elements into groups. The goal is to predict the categorical class labels which are discrete and unordered. Some common use cases include predicting customer default (Yes or No), predicting customer churn (customer will leave or stay), disease found (positive or negative). This module can be used for binary and provides several pre-processing features that prepare the data for modeling through CLI. It has over 18 ready-to-use algorithms and several plots to analyze the performance of trained models.

> Option to run on customized preprocessing configurations (docs :soon:).  

> Provides preprocessing configuration for EDA & making data ready.

> Runs 18 classification and comapres the 
- 'Accuracy'
- 'AUC'
- 'Recall'
- 'Precision'
- 'F1'
- 'Kappa' 
	merics and provides the best model, but still users have an option to override and run their model of interest.

> Option for auto tune hyperparameters based on random grid search.

> Creates a details HTML report with 
- Area Under the Curve
- Discrimination Threshold
- Precision Recall Curve
- Confusion Matrix
- Class Prediction Error
- Classification Report
- Decision Boundary
- Recursive Feature Selection
- Learning Curve
- Manifold Learning
- Calibration Curve
- Validation Curve
- Dimension Learning
- Feature Importance
- Model Hyperparameter
