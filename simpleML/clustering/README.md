# Clustering.


##### What is Clustering?
Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that those in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. It is an exploratory data mining activity, and a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields including machine learning, pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression and computer graphics. Some common real life use cases of clustering are:

Customer segmentation based on purchase history or interests to design targetted marketing compaigns.
Cluster documents into multiple categories based on tags, topics, and the content of the document.
Analysis of outcome in social / life science experiments to find natural groupings and patterns in the data.
