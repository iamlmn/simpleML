# simpleML

Simple ML is python based machcine learning library wrapper over PyCaret.

Aim is to attain no code ML training while still having a transperancy on what technique/model/paramets has been used with just few clicks with neat HTML reports with plots and reduce the hypothesis to insights cycle time in a ML experiment
Altough a lot of cloud providers provide this option and sometimes it may not be worth using it always, and even costlier.

## Work in Progress..
